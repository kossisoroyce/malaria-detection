ðŸ”¬ Excited to share our new research paper: "Automated Malaria Parasite Detection Using YOLOv8 with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation-Enhanced Synthetic Annotations"

We've developed a YOLOv8-based AI model that achieves 99.14% mAP50 for detecting malaria parasites in blood smear images. This could be a game-changer for malaria diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings where expert microscopists are scarce.

Key highlights:
â€¢ Converted 27,558 NIH malaria cell images to YOLO detection format
â€¢ 97.18% precision, 96.39% recall - clinical-grade performance
â€¢ First large-scale YOLO malaria detection dataset publicly available
â€¢ Complete open-source package with model, dataset, and training code

What makes this special? We used CLAHE-enhanced contour detection to create synthetic bounding box annotations, enabling object detection instead of just classification. This provides spatial localization of parasites - crucial for clinical workflows.

Everything is open-source and ready to use:

This represents months of work converting classification data to detection format, training on A100 GPUs, and ensuring reproducible research. We hope this contributes to the fight against malaria and advances automated medical diagnosis.

The paper discusses limitations honestly - synthetic annotations, single species focus, need for clinical validation. But the performance metrics suggest real potential for clinical deployment.

Grateful for the open-source community and NIH for the original dataset. Science works best when we build on each other's work and share resources freely.
